js-bignum-base-converter
========================

Javascript bignum class for addition, multiplication, and base conversion.

Sample code is provided with an implementation of RFC 1924, a joke RFC that says:

>   Implementation Issues

>   Many current processors do not find 128 bit integer arithmetic, as
>   required for this technique, a trivial operation.  This is not
>   considered a serious drawback in the representation, but a flaw of
>   the processor designs.

>   It may be expected that future processors will address this defect,
>   quite possibly before any significant IPv6 deployment has been
>   accomplished.

The sample code uses the bignum class as a replacement for processor support of 128-bit arithmetic.
